Aerofoil is an [i3](http://i3wm.org/)-based Linux distribution with the goal of being as minimal as practical.

It is currently Debian-derived, but there will eventually be versions based on other distributions.




##contributing
Aerofoil is still in the early stages of development; there is no working version yet. If you would like to contribute, please contact us via email, raise an issue in the relevant repository, or join us on IRC.
