title: Aerofoil - i3wm based distribution
---

#Welcome to Aerofoil
Aerofoil is an [i3](http://i3wm.org/)-based Linux distribution with the goal of being low-camber (light) while still generating adequate lift (functionality). Its goal is to be as minimal as practical.

It is currently based of Debian but we want to release versions based on other distributions as well in the future.


##Contributing
Aerofoil is still in the early stages of development and there is no working version yet. If you would like to contribute, please contact us or join us on IRC.
